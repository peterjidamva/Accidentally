    In here i am having contents that basically i do not want everyone to easily access them but if you are able 
    to scroll down to the final point then you could have been able to discover a lot of stuffs
    For the purposes of the study, a secret was any information that a person intended to conceal from one or more individuals.
 
 The study was first published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in May, and was co-authored by Michael Slepian.
 
 It built on his 2012 study which found that people who were distracted by a secret tended to judge tasks to be more arduous than they were in reality.
 For instance, stealing from a person known to you, and stealing from an organisation were put into the category 'theft'.
 
 Distinctions were made between things like emotional infidelity (flirting), and sexual infidelity (cheating).
 
 34 of these categories were listed in the study's appendix along with the questionnaire.
 
 Harmed another person
 Drug use
 Habit/Addiction
 Theft
 Doing something illegal
 Self-harm
 Abortion
 Trauma
 Lie
 Violate trust
 Romantic desire
 Romantic discontent
 Extra-relational thoughts
 Emotional infidelity
 Sexual infidelity
 Been the other woman/man in someone else’s relationship
 Social discontent (disliking a friend)
 Work cheating
 Poor work performance
 Marriage proposal (planning)
 Surprise
 Hobby
 Hidden relationship
 Family detail (something about your family kept secret)
 Pregnant
 Sexual orientation
 Sexual behaviour
 Not having sex
 Preference (pretending to like something you don’t)
 Belief or ideology
 Finances
 Employment (secret job)
 Ambition
 Unusual behaviour
 Some secrets were so personal to a participant that they did not fit into one of the other categories.
 
 13 Common Secrets
 The study showed the compiled categories to a new set of participants.
 
 On average each person currently was keeping at least 13 secrets from the list.
 
 According to the study, at least five of them were ones they had never told to anybody.
 
 The most common secrets:
 
 60 per cent - a lie or financial impropriety
 47 per cent - a violation of trust
 33 per cent - theft, a hidden relationship, or discontent at work
 Burden of secrets
 The study found that secrets weigh on us, even when there's little danger that they will be uncovered.
 
 Measuring the frequency of 'mind wandering' onto one's secrets, the study
  found that people dwell on their secrets on a more frequent basis than when they are 
  'actively concealing' the secret from a person or group of people.
